      <div id="tribute-info">Lauda won the F1 drivers' championship in 1975 and 1977 with Ferrari and again in 1984 with
        McLaren. In 1976, he was badly burned when he crashed during the German Grand Prix, but he made an astonishingly
        fast return to racing just six weeks later. The story of Lauda's 1976 season was one of remarkable bravery and
        resilience and in 2013 it was turned into the movie Rush, directed by Ron Howard.</div>
